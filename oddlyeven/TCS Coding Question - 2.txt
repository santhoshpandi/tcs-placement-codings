TCS Coding Question - 2

Oddly Even:
Given a maximum of 100 digit numbers as input, find the difference between the sum of odd and even position digits.

Case 1:
Input: 4567
Expected Output: 2
Explantion : Odd positions are 4 and 6 as they are pos: 1 and pos: 3, both have sum 10. Similarly, 5 and 7 are at even positions pos: 2 and pos: 4 with sum 12. Thus, difference is 12 - 10 = 2
