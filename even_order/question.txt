TCS Coding Question - 3

Consider the following series: 0,0,2,1,4,2,6,3,8,4,10,5,12,6,14,7,16,8
This series is a mixture of 2 series, all the odd terms in this series form even numbers in ascending order and every even terms is derived from the previous term using the formula (x/2).Write a program to find the nth term in this series.

Explantion : The value of n is a positive integer that should be read from STDIN and the nth term that is to be calculated by the program should be written to STDOUT. Other than the value of the nth term, no other characters /strings or message should be written to STDOUT.
For example:If n=10, the 10th term in the series is to be derived from the 9th term in the series. The 9th term is 8 so the 10th term is (8/2)=4. Only the value 4 should be printed to STDOUT.
You can assume that the n will not exceed 20,000.
